## Seizure Detection
The objective is to create a prototype that will enable safe driving of patients who have been suffering from drug resistant epilepsy and tonic seizures. This will be achieved by applying emergency brakes to the vehicle and sending alert messages to patients contacts when the patient is just about to have a seizure.<br>
## Abstract
About 1 % of the general population suffers from epilepsy which lead to constant seizures. Normal under every other circumstance, patients only have challenges in motor skills during a seizure. Over the years, seizure prediction has garnered humongous interest and extensive research is being carried out on the same. Many outstanding studies have been successful in providing high performing mechanisms that either give direct or indirect warnings.  However, to make It extremely fault tolerant with high sensitivity and minimum false prediction rate these models are generally tailor made for each patient individually. <br><br>
In our approach we use convolutional neural networks to EEG datasets and create a model that gives generalized retrospective methods of prediction and detection. The model extracts feature by itself to classify the preictal and interictal segments. This method can be extended to new patients without having the need to specify features to be extracted. <br>
