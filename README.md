Project Idea-1
 
1.Project Title
Small Steps, Big Changes- Common Fundraising Portal

2.Project idea description
This application aims at creating a common portal for donating to a fundraiser or creating a fundraiser yourself. There will be two personas, the Donor and the Cause. The Donor can search for her choice of donations based on customized filters. Their donating patterns will be harvested and later analyzed to suggest causes they will be interested in. The donors will receive a notification personally to encourage their donations Persona Cause can create their donations on the portal to ask for the donations. There will be a payment gateway for secure payment of donations.

3.Goal of the project (who are you developing the project for)
The goal is to provide a common portal for both, people who want to give money to a good cause and people who need money for a noble cause.

4.Technology stack: ReactJS -FrontEnd, NodeJS(ExpressJS) – ServerRedux -State Maintenance,Amazon ec2 – Hosting the tool on cloud, RDS, Kubernetes, Tableau, Docker                                                                                                                                    	
Project Idea 2:

1.Project Title: Skin Disease detection based on Images of body parts.

2.Description: The application will predict the disease (external condition) based on the images provided by the user. The aim is to cover abnormal skin conditions like eczema, rashes, ringworm, swelling, etc. It will employ methods of Image Processing to perform color enhancement and noise removal, medium-level methods such as compression and binarization, and higher-level methods involving segmentation, detection, and recognition in cases where prediction is not conclusive. In such scenarios, it will give a probabilistic measure of the prediction.

3.Goal of the Project: Develop an app that can predict skin abnormalities based on pictures clicked by regular phone cameras. The application aims to have a very easy and interactive interface to give a sooth user experience.

4.Technology: OpenCV, Python, ReactJS, NodeJS(ExpressJS), MongoDB, Redux, Docker, AWS 


Project Idea-3

1.Project Title- Drowsiness Detection using facial landmarks.


2.Description- A camera will monitor a stream for faces and detect drowsiness of a person by using facial recognition and blinking activity.
The application will make sound to wake people when it detects someone is feeling sleepy. It will also display the degree of drowsiness and after crossing a certain threshold it can send a notification to emergency contacts to alert them. 

3.Project Goal - This will keep people safe and prevent road accidents where people sleep while driving. Target Audience will be the common people who own or drive cars. 

4.Technology Stack- Cascade Pose Regression, Python, AWS, Docker, OpenCV, React JS, dlib, ActualG, Histogram of Oriented Gradients.
